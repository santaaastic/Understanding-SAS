/* UNDERSTANDING DIFFERENCE BETWEEN IF AND WHERE STATEMENTS AND EXECUTION TIME DIFFERENCES */

/* What?- If and where statements are used for subsetting data. */
/* Why?- It is important to understand when to where which of these statements as they have impacts on the execution time and they can be used selectively in some scenaario */
/* The execution time difference increases as the size of datasets increase */
/* Where statement IS MORE EFFICIENT than if statement because it subsets the data first and then reads it */

/* How?- Lets try subsetting data using if and where statemets and check the time lapse. */

/* But though we know where is more efficient we cannot use it everywhere. */

/* Cases in which IF supremacy exists: */
/* 1. Entering data using input statement. */
/* 2. Multiple conditions  */
/* 3. Newly created variables in the same dataset. */
/* 4. Automatic Variables : _N_, first., last. */

/* Cases in which WHERE supremacy exists */

/* 1. Merging datasets in data step. */
/* 2. With Proc statements */
/* 3. As an option statement */

/* Cited from : ListenData: */

/* "The where clause sends only those records that meet condition to PDV, the IF statement sends */
/*  all the records to PDV and removes the records that do not meet condition before they  */
/*  get sent to the output buffer." */
